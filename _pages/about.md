I'm a third-year master student from [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany. My research interests include computer vision, neural rendering and generative models. Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), China in 2021.

[Mipmap-GS: Let Gaussians Deform with Scale-specific Mipmap for Anti-aliasing Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06286)

***[Jiameng Li](https://renaissanceee.github.io/)**, [Yue shi](https://shiyue001.github.io/), [Jiezhang Cao](https://shiyue001.github.io/](https://www.jiezhangcao.com/), Bingbing Ni, Wenjun Zhang, Kai Zhang, Luc Van Gool*

We propose a unified optimization method to make Gaussians adaptive for arbitrary scales. Inspired by the mipmap technique, we design mipmap-like pseudo-GT at the target scale and introduce a scale-consistency guidance loss to inject scale information into 3D Gaussians. Our self-adjusting method is applicable in any 3DGS models for scale-adaptive and deformable Gaussian fields.
